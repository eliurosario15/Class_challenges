Module one challenge.

                User Story
AS A marketing agency
I WANT a codebase that follows accessibility standards
SO THAT our own site is optimized for search engines

             Acceptance Criteria 

GIVEN a webpage meets accessibility standards
WHEN I view the source code
THEN I find semantic HTML elements
WHEN I view the structure of the HTML elements
THEN I find that the elements follow a logical structure independent of styling and positioning
WHEN I view the image elements
THEN I find accessible alt attributes
WHEN I view the heading attributes
THEN they fall in sequential order
WHEN I view the title element
THEN I find a concise, descriptive title

Steps Taken: 

* Added a description for every section of out HTML code. This makes the reading and review
of the code easier.

* Replaced the <div> tag with other HTML semantics. This makes reading the code easier. It
also makes the code cleaner and easier to modify.

* Added alt attirbutes to the images on the <main> section of the code.

* Added a <title> related and descriptive of the content of our webpage.

* As extra practice, added a <span> title with the company full name when hovering over 
the page main header.
